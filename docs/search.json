    "text": "A Preliminary Definition of Risk, Risk Perception, and Resilience\nThe usage of the three key words (risk, risk perception, and resilience) in the research literature is varied. Some attempts have been made at collating these divergent definitions, notably by Aven (2022). They present six distinct perspectives, roughly named the disjunct, broader disjunct, event, consequence, undesirable potentials, and combination perspectives. Depending on the perspective, risks are defined variably as reduction in functionality, events, consequences, and/or uncertainties related to consequences. Similarly, resilience is variably defined as recovering ability, reaction ability, or even not defined at all (Aven, 2022).\nThe problems with most of these perspectives, according to Aven (2022), is that they distinctly draw lines between risks and resilience. Particularly in the two disjunct perspectives as well as the event perspective, the risk ends once the event is declared over and the recovery phase as begun - the two stages are incommensurable."

    "text": "Risk and Systems\nPerceptions of flood risk in particular have been found to correlate with perceptions of other technological risks (Zhai & Ikeda, 2008).\nIt is important to distinguish between the ontology and the perception of risks. The former refers to the contents, dynamics, and structure of the risk itself, while the latter refers to individual’s meaning-makings of risks.\nIn the space of risk ontology, research has suggested that risks can be divided into global systemic risks (GSR) and conventional risks (Renn, 2021; Renn et al., 2019; Renn et al., 2022). Summarily, GSR’s transgress traditional social and scientific boundaries, are intertwined and interconnected with one another, present non-linear causality in their structure, and have non-deterministic effects (Haas et al., 2022).\nNon-deterministic effects cannot be adequately reduced to deterministic models.\nHowever, risk ontology is not the same as risk perception."

    "text": "Risk Perception\nRisk perception has been widely studied in the past two decades, but is still lacking a coherent theoretical framework (Kellens et al., 2013). Generally speaking, perception has been found to be related to both hazard experiences and reactive behaviour.\nPerception is related to behaviour in some way, but the causal connection is unclear (Koning et al., 2017). It has been shown that post-event risk decision-making is drastically reactive to the event (Gallagher, 2014; Slovic et al., 2004). The time after event is also very relevant, with post-event risk perception not only falling, but falling at a speed derivative of the time post-event (Atreya et al., 2013; Bin & Landry, 2013; Gallagher, 2014). One study found that storm risk perception drops below objective risk probabilities given enough time between events, but rises rapidly upon the following event (Magliocca & Walls, 2018)."

    "section": "Experiences and Perception",
    "text": "Experiences and Perception\nThe previous literature generally distinguishes between two types of experience: direct and near-miss experiences. Direct experiences are, as the name implies, directly and non-mediately experienced, while near-miss experiences are situations that could have resulted in the expression of the hazard event, but did not. As an example, a direct experience of a fire could be a stove fire in the individual’s kitchen, while a near-miss experience of a fire could be a situation where the individual noticed that they had left flammable materials on an active stove-top, but managed to remove the materials prior to them catching fire.\nHowever, we propose that risk experiences are much more varied than this. We suggest five distinct forms, borrowed from and inspired by inter-group contact theory (ICT, Zhou, 2020).\n\nDirect non-intensive experience\nDirect intensive experience\nExtended experience\nImagined experience\nMediated experience\n\nThe first two experiences represent the regular direct experience, with a clear distinction: the intensity in the experience is much greater in type (2) than in type (1). Burning food on the stove-top is an example of a direct non-intensive experience, while surviving a house fire is a direct intensive experience.1\nIf extended contact in ICT is “knowing that another ingroup member has at least one cross-group friend” (Zhou, 2020, p. 9), then extended risk experiences is knowing that a significant other has experienced the hazard event in question.\nImagined experience represents near misses, but with an emphasis on the imaginative part. In this perspective, the causally empowered aspect is not how the experience is ‘almost like a risk’ (i.e., risk resemblance), but the near-miss as a trigger for considering a potential risk realisation. In other words: the near-miss triggers the individual to consider what the risk could have looked like and how it could have played out, which itself triggers a reconsideration of the probabilities attached to the risk event.\nMediated experience is the experiencing the risk as portrayed in media (cf. Zhou, 2020, p. 15). This differs from the extended experience in that the originator of the message is not a significant other of the individual. Risks are experienced mediated all the time: from COVID-19 discussions on social media to news events of the war in Ukraine, individuals are constantly exposed to mediated experiences. In risk perception research, this topic has been studied under the sub-topic of risk communication studies.\nOne motivation for using these distinctive forms of experience may be drawn from social phenomenology.\n\nThe base world of work and the doxic position (Bégout, 2007; Heidegger, 1962, pp. (56–57); Schütz, 1962, p. 227).\nAction oriented towards goals or projects (Heidegger, 1962, p. (145); Schütz, 1967, pp. 59–64).\nIdeal-typical projection requires familiarity and typicality (Schütz, 2011, pp. 126–128).\nRecognition of familiarity/typicality occurs through relevance systems: topical, interpretational, and motivational relevance (Schütz, 2011, pp. 94–95, 108, 113, 119)."

Data were processed using the tidyverse (Wickham et al., 2019) and naniar (Tierney & Cook, 2023) packages. Plots and graphs were generated in ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016), including the ggstatsplot (Patil, 2021) extension package. MDS rotations were done in smacof (Mair et al., 2022) and partial correlations with ppcor (Kim, 2015). Network comparison was conducted in NetworkComparisonTest (Van Borkulo et al., 2022). Network graphs and related plotting and statistics were conducted in bootnet (Epskamp et al., 2018) and qgraph (Epskamp et al., 2012). The article was written in RMarkdown and compiled using the knitr (Xie, 2014, 2015, 2023) package for reproducibility.\nWe started by fitting a model for the graphical representation of networks. We modelled a partial correlation network of the risk perception variables using the multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique (Jones et al., 2018). We thus retrieved Shepard curves for each MDS type and chose model type by balancing parsimony with increasing fit (reduction of the stress factor, see (Jones et al., 2018)). This model was only used to construct the MDS model.\nFor the main analysis, we fitted a pairwise Markov random field (PMRF) model as a Gaussian graphical model (GGM). We used Spearman correlations and the EBICglasso estimator function (Epskamp et al., 2012; Foygel & Drton, 2010). We fitted two models: a non-parametric model and a case-dropping network model. The former was used for presenting and analysing the network as a graph and as a plot of centrality indices, and the latter was used for analysing the stability of centrality indices on both system- and node levels (Epskamp et al., 2018).\nComment: Add more description here, especially in how to interpret CS coefficients and bootstrapped centrality measures.\nTo compare between groups, we estimated group-wise Gaussian graphical models and used the network comparison test (NCT) as outlined by Fried, Epskamp, Veerman and van Borkulo (2022)."

The model uses the EBICglasso algorithm, which searches for the model that locally minimises the extended Bayesian Information Criterion (Epskamp et al., 2018; Foygel & Drton, 2010). The estimation is done using Spearman correlations because our data are expected non-normally distributed. While polychoric correlations would be possible, the small sample sizes in sub-population comparison may result in a non-positive definite correlation matrix, which disables analysis. We retrieved both non-parametric and case-dropping networks for analysis.\n\n\n\nThe robust network is plotted using the two-dimensional MDS solution as its layout, enabling us to interpret graphical distance as a proxy for vertex strength.

Most other connections are fairly weak, with low-to-medium partial correlations.\nThe strongest connections are between Traffic and Fire (strength = 0.39). Most nodes have only positive connections, with nuclear, work, illness, and hybrid being the only nodes with connections below zero. Mean connection strength is low across most nodes, but variation among nodes is comparatively high.\nFour node connections are negative: Fire-Hybrid (0), Nuclear-Hybrid (-0.02), Work-Illness (-0.07), and Hybrid-Work (-0.01).\nFigure 6 shows node centrality measures by node and measure. Strength varies between 0.6 for extreme weather phenomena and 1.1 for fire.\nCloseness is very low, with every node around 0.005 in closeness. The similarity in scores suggests that nodes are fairly evenly connected.\nBetweenness, however, is much more varied. Weather presents a betweenness of zero, meaning that it does not feature in any shortest path connection in the network. At the other end, Environmental and Illness feature in fourteen shortest paths, thus being very central nodes in the network.\nAs there are very few negative connections, expected influence mirrors strength for most nodes. Fire, Nuclear, Work, Illness, Operational, and Hybrid present at least one negative connection, which results in their expected influence being slightly lower than their strength.\nTable 2 shows the smallworldness statistics for the network. The smallworldness index is not substantially larger than either 1 or 3, suggesting that the network is not a small-world network (Humphries & Gurney, 2008; Newman, 2003). Neither transitivity nor average path length (APL) is substantially higher than their randomly generated counterparts, further suggesting that the network is not considered a small-world network.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Smallworldness statistics of bootstrapped network, 1000 permutations for random networks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmallworldness Index\nTransitivity\nAPL\nRandom transitivity (95% CI)\nRandom APL (95% CI)\n\n\n\n\n1.024\n0.731\n1.264\n0.714 (0.695-0.736)\n1.264 (1.264-1.264)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Centrality measures of bootstrapped network, raw scores.\n\n\n\n\nThe case-dropped models can be correlated with the original model to estimate how well the case-dropped model centrality measures represent the original. The correlation stability coefficient (CS coefficient) then determines the proportion of cases that may be dropped whilst still retaining a correlation of \\(r = p\\), where \\(p\\) is the preferred correlational level, in \\((1-\\alpha)/100\\) % of cases. For this study, we use the default values of \\(r = 0.7\\) and \\(95\\) per cent.\nPrevious research suggests that, when interpreting differences between centralities (e.g., if one risk perception is more central to the network than another), the centrality stability coefficient should preferably be above 0.5, with higher equalling a more stable centrality measure (Epskamp et al., 2018; Fried et al., 2022).\nFigure 7 shows the stability of the centrality measures when case-dropping. The CS coefficients are listed in Table 3. Strength, closeness and expected influence are all stable, with up to 75 per cent of cases having to be dropped before the correlation drops below 0.7 in 95% of bootstraps. However, betweenness does not seem to be stable enough to interpret, at a CS coefficient of only 0.36.\n\n\nTable 3: Correlation Stability (CS) coefficients of the bootstrapped model\n\n\nMeasure\nCS coefficient\n\n\n\n\nBetweenness\n0.36\n\n\nCloseness\n0.75\n\n\nExpected Influence\n0.75\n\n\nStrength\n0.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Stability plot\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 shows significance tests of the differences in connection strengths between each node-pair vertex, ordered by connection strength in the original estimated network. In other words, we tested whether two connections significantly differ from each other at \\(\\alpha = 0.05\\). Around half of the comparisons are significant. The Work-Illness vertex is significantly different from every other vertex. Traffic-Fire and Hybrid-Polarization are both significantly different from all other vertices except from each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Connection pair-wise significance tests.

There were some Github discussions about similar problems - is this, too, a bug?\nDirect experience of fire is related to a weak effect on network structure (Table 4 (a)). Global strength is significantly different, indicating that the overall connectivity has changed between networks. However, network variance is not significantly different. Since the network is dense and non-smallworld, the difference between variance and strength may be due to small changes in many network edges leading to a overall significant change in the sum of edge strength, while leaving individual maximum changes small (see Van Borkulo et al., 2022).\nNear-miss experiences have a stronger effect on the network structure (Table 4 (b)). Network variance and global strength are both significantly different, suggesting that a change in overall network structure has occurred. In both cases, the statistic has grown in the network estimated from respondents that have experienced a near miss. In other words: the network seems to be slightly denser in people who have nearly experienced a fire.\nFinally, working in emergency services is related to a weak effect on network structure, but inverse to that of a direct fire experience (Table 4 (c)). Network variance is significantly different, indicating that one or more edges have distinctly changed. However, global strength difference is non-significant, suggesting that these changes have not resulted in an overall change in the total edge strength of the network. In other words: working in emergency services is related to a shift in network structure, but not an increase or decrease in density per se.\nFor the Fire node, no changes seem to have occurred in either the near-miss or the EMS employment comparisons. However, for individuals who have a direct fire experience, Expected Influence has dropped significantly. This suggests that the connections between Fire and other nodes has grown slightly more negative. Because the network does not show any negative edges (Figure 9 (b)), this change corresponds to a drop in intensity of positive connections. The Fire node also shows marginally significant changes on closeness and strength in the direct experience comparison. The change in strength mirrors that of the EI change, further suggesting that the centrality of Fire has slightly dropped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) No direct experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Direct experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) No near-miss experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(d) Near-miss experience\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(e) Not in EMS employment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(f) In EMS employment\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Gaussian graphical models of risk perception by substantive control variables, compared using network comparison testing"
